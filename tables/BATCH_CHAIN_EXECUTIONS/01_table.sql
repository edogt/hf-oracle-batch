/**
 * Table: BATCH_CHAIN_EXECUTIONS
 * Description: Tracks the execution of batch chains.
 *              Records start/end times, execution states, and execution context
 *              for complete traceability of chain execution lifecycle.
 *
 * Author: Eduardo Guti√©rrez Tapia (edogt@hotmail.com)
 *
 * Purpose:
 *   - Track chain execution lifecycle (start, running, finished, failed)
 *   - Record execution timing and performance metrics
 *   - Provide execution context for process and activity executions
 *   - Enable execution monitoring and reporting
 *   - Support execution history and audit trails
 *
 * Usage in PCK_BATCH_MANAGER:
 *   - Created by chain_execution_register() at chain start
 *   - Updated by chain_exec_end_register() at chain completion
 *   - Referenced by saveChainExecution() for CRUD operations
 *   - Used by setChainExecutionEndState() for state management
 *   - Provides context for process and activity executions
 *
 * Usage:
 *   - Referenced by BATCH_PROCESS_EXECUTIONS (chain_exec_id FK)
 *   - Referenced by BATCH_ACTIVITY_EXECUTIONS (chain_execution_id FK)
 *   - Referenced by BATCH_SIMPLE_LOG (chain_execution_id FK)
 *   - Used in monitoring views (V_BATCH_CHAIN_EXECUTIONS, V_BATCH_RUNNING_CHAINS)
 *   - Supports execution reporting and performance analysis
