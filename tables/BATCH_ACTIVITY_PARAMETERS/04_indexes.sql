 * Description: Indexes to improve query performance for activity parameter lookups.

 * Author: Eduardo Guti√©rrez Tapia (edogt@hotmail.com)

 * Purpose:
 *   - Speed up lookups by ACTIVITY_ID, as parameters are always queried in the context of an activity.
 *   - Support efficient joins with BATCH_ACTIVITIES.
