/**
 * Indexes: BATCH_CHAIN_PROCESSES
 * Description: Indexes to improve query performance for chain-process relationship lookups.
 *
 * Author: Eduardo Guti√©rrez Tapia (edogt@hotmail.com)
 *
 * Purpose:
 *   - Speed up lookups by CHAIN_ID and PROCESS_ID
 *   - Support efficient joins with BATCH_CHAINS and BATCH_PROCESSES
 *   - Improve performance for chain composition and execution queries
