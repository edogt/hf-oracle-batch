/**
 * Table: BATCH_CHAIN_PROCESSES
 * Description: Defines the relationship between chains and processes.
 *              Maps processes to chains with execution order and dependency
 *              information for orchestrated batch execution.
 *
 * Author: Eduardo Guti√©rrez Tapia (edogt@hotmail.com)
 *
 * Purpose:
 *   - Associate processes with chains for orchestrated execution
 *   - Define execution order and dependencies between processes
 *   - Enable chain-based process scheduling and coordination
 *   - Support process dependency management within chains
 *   - Provide chain composition and structure definition
 *
 * Usage in PCK_BATCH_MANAGER:
 *   - Referenced by getChainProcesses() function for chain execution
 *   - Used by add_process_to_chain() for chain composition
 *   - Supports ordered process execution within chains
 *   - Enables dependency-based process scheduling
 *   - Provides chain structure for execution orchestration
 *
 * Usage:
 *   - Referenced by BATCH_CHAINS (chain_id FK)
 *   - Referenced by BATCH_PROCESSES (process_id FK)
 *   - Used for chain execution orchestration
 *   - Supports process dependency management
 *   - Enables chain composition and structure definition
