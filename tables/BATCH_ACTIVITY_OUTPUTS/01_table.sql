/**
 * Table: BATCH_ACTIVITY_OUTPUTS
 * Description: Stores output data and results from batch activity executions.
 *              Captures the actual output values, files, and results generated
 *              by activities during their execution.
 *
 * Author: Eduardo Guti√©rrez Tapia (edogt@hotmail.com)
 *
 * Purpose:
 *   - Store output data and results from activity executions
 *   - Enable output processing and file management
 *   - Support result tracking and analysis
 *   - Provide output context for reporting and monitoring
 *   - Allow output-based workflow decisions
 *
 * Usage in PCK_BATCH_MANAGER:
 *   - Processed by processActivityOutputs() procedure
 *   - Supports output file management (move_to, send_to)
 *   - Enables dynamic output processing with evaluateText()
 *   - Used for output directory configuration and file naming
 *   - Supports output-based notifications and routing
 *
 * Usage:
 *   - Referenced by BATCH_ACTIVITY_EXECUTIONS (activity_execution_id FK)
 *   - Referenced by BATCH_ACTIVITIES (activity_id FK)
 *   - Used for output processing and file management
 *   - Supports output-based workflow orchestration
