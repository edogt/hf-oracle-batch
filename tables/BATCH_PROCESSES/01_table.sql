/**
 * Table: BATCH_PROCESSES
 * Description: Core entity defining batch processes within chains.
 *              Represents the intermediate level of batch orchestration,
 *              containing activities, configuration, and execution rules.
 *
 * Author: Eduardo Guti√©rrez Tapia (edogt@hotmail.com)
 *
 * Purpose:
 *   - Define batch processes within execution chains
 *   - Store process configuration and execution rules
 *   - Enable process-based activity orchestration
 *   - Support process scheduling and execution
 *   - Provide process context for monitoring and reporting
 *
 * Usage in PCK_BATCH_MANAGER:
 *   - Referenced by getProcessByCode() function for process retrieval
 *   - Used by process_execution_register() for execution initiation
 *   - Supports getProcessActivities() for activity orchestration
 *   - Enables process-based execution context and monitoring
 *   - Provides process configuration for execution rules
 *
 * Usage:
 *   - Referenced by BATCH_PROCESS_ACTIVITIES (process_id FK)
 *   - Referenced by BATCH_PROCESS_EXECUTIONS (process_id FK)
 *   - Referenced by BATCH_CHAIN_PROCESSES (process_id FK)
 *   - Used in monitoring views (V_BATCH_PROCESS_EXECUTIONS, V_BATCH_RUNNING_PROCESSES)
 *   - Supports process-based activity orchestration and execution
