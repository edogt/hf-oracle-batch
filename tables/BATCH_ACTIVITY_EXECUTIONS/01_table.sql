/**
 * Table: BATCH_ACTIVITY_EXECUTIONS
 * Description: Execution tracking and lifecycle management for individual batch activities.
 *              Records the complete execution history of activity instances,
 *              including timing, status transitions, and execution context.
 *
 * Author: Eduardo Guti√©rrez Tapia (edogt@hotmail.com)
 *
 * Purpose:
 *   - Track individual activity execution lifecycle from start to completion
 *   - Provide execution context for activity parameter values and outputs
 *   - Enable activity-level execution monitoring and audit trails
 *   - Support execution status management and error handling
 *   - Maintain execution history for performance analysis and troubleshooting
 *
 * Usage in PCK_BATCH_MANAGER:
 *   - Created by activity_execution_register() function
 *   - Updated by activity_exec_end_register() procedure
 *   - Managed by saveActivityExecution() procedure
 *   - Referenced by BATCH_ACTIV_EXEC_PARAM_VALUES for parameter tracking
 *   - Referenced by BATCH_ACTIVITY_OUTPUTS for result storage
 *   - Supports simulation mode execution tracking
 *   - Enables execution rollback and cleanup operations
 *
 * Usage:
 *   - Referenced by BATCH_ACTIV_EXEC_PARAM_VALUES (activity_execution_id FK)
 *   - Referenced by BATCH_ACTIVITY_OUTPUTS (activity_execution_id FK)
 *   - Referenced by BATCH_SIMPLE_LOG (activity_execution_id FK)
 *   - Used in all activity execution views for monitoring
 *   - Links to BATCH_ACTIVITIES (activity_id FK) and BATCH_PROCESS_EXECUTIONS (process_exec_id FK)
