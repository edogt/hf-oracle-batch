/**
 * Table: BATCH_PROCESS_EXECUTIONS
 * Description: Execution tracking and lifecycle management for batch processes.
 *              Records the complete execution history of process instances,
 *              including timing, status transitions, and execution context.
 *
 * Author: Eduardo Guti√©rrez Tapia (edogt@hotmail.com)
 *
 * Purpose:
 *   - Track individual process execution lifecycle from start to completion
 *   - Provide execution context for process activities and outputs
 *   - Enable process-level execution monitoring and audit trails
 *   - Support execution status management and error handling
 *   - Maintain execution history for performance analysis and troubleshooting
 *
 * Usage in PCK_BATCH_MANAGER:
 *   - Created by process_execution_register() function
 *   - Updated by process_exec_end_register() procedure
 *   - Managed by saveProcessExecution() procedure
 *   - Referenced by BATCH_ACTIVITY_EXECUTIONS for activity tracking
 *   - Supports simulation mode execution tracking
 *   - Enables execution rollback and cleanup operations
 *
 * Usage:
 *   - Referenced by BATCH_ACTIVITY_EXECUTIONS (process_exec_id FK)
 *   - Referenced by BATCH_SIMPLE_LOG (process_execution_id FK)
 *   - Used in all process execution views for monitoring
 *   - Links to BATCH_PROCESSES (process_id FK) and BATCH_CHAIN_EXECUTIONS (chain_exec_id FK)
