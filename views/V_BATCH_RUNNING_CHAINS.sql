/**
 * View: V_BATCH_RUNNING_CHAINS
 * Description: Real-time view of currently running batch chains with company context.
 *              Provides immediate visibility into active chain executions
 *              including timing and company information for operational monitoring.
 *
 * Author: Eduardo GutiÃ©rrez Tapia (edogt@hotmail.com)
 *
 * Purpose:
 *   - Monitor currently running chain executions in real-time
 *   - Provide operational visibility into active workflow processes
 *   - Support chain execution monitoring and alerting
 *   - Enable real-time performance analysis of running chains
 *
 * Query Description:
 *   - Filters chain executions to show only RUNNING state
 *   - Joins with chains and companies to provide complete context
 *   - Uses PCK_BATCH_TOOLS.ENLAPSEDTIMESTRING for elapsed time calculation
 *   - Provides immediate operational visibility for monitoring dashboards
 *
 * Usage Examples:
 * 
 * -- Get all currently running chains
 * SELECT * FROM V_BATCH_RUNNING_CHAINS 
 * ORDER BY START_TIME;
 *
 * -- Get running chains for a specific company
 * SELECT * FROM V_BATCH_RUNNING_CHAINS 
 * WHERE COMPANIA_DESCRIPCION = 'ACME Corp'
 * ORDER BY START_TIME;
 *
 * -- Get long-running chains (> 1 hour)
 * SELECT * FROM V_BATCH_RUNNING_CHAINS 
 * WHERE START_TIME < SYSTIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '0 1:0:0' DAY TO SECOND
 * ORDER BY START_TIME;
 *
 * -- Get chain execution summary by company
 * SELECT COMPANIA_DESCRIPCION, COUNT(*) as running_chains,
 *        AVG(EXTRACT(SECOND FROM (SYSTIMESTAMP - START_TIME))) as avg_running_seconds
 * FROM V_BATCH_RUNNING_CHAINS 
 * GROUP BY COMPANIA_DESCRIPCION
 * ORDER BY running_chains DESC;
 *
 * -- Get potentially stuck chains (> 4 hours)
 * SELECT * FROM V_BATCH_RUNNING_CHAINS 
 * WHERE START_TIME < SYSTIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '0 4:0:0' DAY TO SECOND
 * ORDER BY START_TIME;
 *
 * -- Get chains by execution type
 * SELECT EXECUTION_TYPE, COUNT(*) as running_chains,
 *        MIN(START_TIME) as earliest_start,
 *        MAX(START_TIME) as latest_start
 * FROM V_BATCH_RUNNING_CHAINS 
 * GROUP BY EXECUTION_TYPE
 * ORDER BY running_chains DESC;
