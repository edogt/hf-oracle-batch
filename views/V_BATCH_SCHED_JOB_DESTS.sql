 * ORDER BY JOB_NAME, DESTINATION;
 *
 * -- Get destinations by type
 * SELECT DESTINATION_TYPE, COUNT(*) as destination_count,
 *        COUNT(DISTINCT JOB_NAME) as unique_jobs
 * FROM V_BATCH_SCHED_JOB_DESTS 
 * GROUP BY DESTINATION_TYPE
 * ORDER BY destination_count DESC;
 *
 * -- Get destinations for a specific job
 * SELECT * FROM V_BATCH_SCHED_JOB_DESTS 
 * WHERE JOB_NAME = 'DAILY_BATCH_JOB'
 * ORDER BY DESTINATION;
 *
 * -- Get jobs with multiple destinations
 * SELECT JOB_NAME, COUNT(*) as destination_count
 * FROM V_BATCH_SCHED_JOB_DESTS 
 * GROUP BY JOB_NAME
 * HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
 * ORDER BY destination_count DESC;

 * SELECT * FROM V_BATCH_SCHED_JOB_DESTS 
 * WHERE DESTINATION_VALUE LIKE '%PROD%'
 * ORDER BY JOB_NAME;
 *
 * -- Get destination summary
 * SELECT 
 *   COUNT(*) as total_destinations,
