/**
 * View: V_BATCH_ACTIVS_LAST_EXECS
 * Description: Last activity executions view with hierarchical context and timing information.
 *              Provides recent activity execution history including chain relationships,
 *              process activities, and formatted timing for monitoring and analysis.
 *
 * Author: Eduardo GutiÃ©rrez Tapia (edogt@hotmail.com)
 *
 * Purpose:
 *   - Monitor recent activity execution history and status
 *   - Provide activity execution timing analysis and reporting
 *   - Support activity performance monitoring and trend analysis
 *   - Enable activity execution tracking with chain and process context
 *
 * Query Description:
 *   - Joins activity executions with activities, chains, process executions, and process activities
 *   - Uses outer joins to include activities not associated with chains or processes
 *   - Formats timestamps and calculates elapsed time using PCK_BATCH_TOOLS
 *   - Orders results by execution ID descending (most recent first)
 *
 * Usage Examples:
 * 
 * -- Get all recent activity executions
 * SELECT * FROM V_BATCH_ACTIVS_LAST_EXECS 
 * ORDER BY EXEC_ID DESC;
 *
 * -- Get completed activities
 * SELECT * FROM V_BATCH_ACTIVS_LAST_EXECS 
 * WHERE EXECUTION_STATE = 'COMPLETED'
 * ORDER BY EXEC_ID DESC;
 *
 * -- Get activities for a specific chain
 * SELECT * FROM V_BATCH_ACTIVS_LAST_EXECS 
 * WHERE CHAIN = 'DAILY_BATCH_CHAIN'
 * ORDER BY START_TIME DESC;
 *
 * -- Get long-running activities (> 30 minutes)
 * SELECT * FROM V_BATCH_ACTIVS_LAST_EXECS 
 * WHERE EXECUTION_STATE = 'RUNNING'
 * AND START_TIME < SYSTIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '0 0:30:0' DAY TO SECOND
 * ORDER BY START_TIME;
 *
 * -- Get activity execution summary by chain
 * SELECT CHAIN, COUNT(*) as total_executions,
 *        SUM(CASE WHEN EXECUTION_STATE = 'COMPLETED' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as completed,
 *        SUM(CASE WHEN EXECUTION_STATE = 'FAILED' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as failed
 * FROM V_BATCH_ACTIVS_LAST_EXECS 
 * WHERE CHAIN IS NOT NULL
 * GROUP BY CHAIN
 * ORDER BY total_executions DESC;
 *
 * -- Get recent executions for a specific activity
 * SELECT * FROM V_BATCH_ACTIVS_LAST_EXECS 
 * WHERE CODE = 'DATA_EXTRACTION'
 * ORDER BY EXEC_ID DESC;
 *
 * -- Get failed activities with details
 * SELECT * FROM V_BATCH_ACTIVS_LAST_EXECS 
 * WHERE EXECUTION_STATE = 'FAILED'
 * ORDER BY START_TIME DESC;
