 * View: V_BATCH_SCHED_CHAINS
 * Description: Oracle Scheduler chain information view with company context.
 *              Provides comprehensive chain scheduling information including
 *              execution status, timing, and company ownership for monitoring and management.
 *
 * Author: Eduardo GutiÃ©rrez Tapia (edogt@hotmail.com)
 *
 * Purpose:
 *   - Monitor Oracle Scheduler chain status and scheduling
 *   - Provide chain execution history and next run information
 *   - Support chain management across multiple companies
 *   - Enable chain scheduling analysis and reporting
 *
 * Query Description:
 *   - Joins BATCH_CHAINS with BATCH_COMPANIES to provide company context
 *   - Includes all chain scheduling attributes and execution status
 *   - Provides complete chain information for monitoring and management
 *   - Supports filtering and analysis by company
 *
 * Usage Examples:
 * 
 * -- Get all active chains
 * SELECT * FROM V_BATCH_SCHED_CHAINS 
 * WHERE SCHEDULE_STATE = 'ACTIVE';
 *
 * -- Get chains for a specific company
 * SELECT * FROM V_BATCH_SCHED_CHAINS 
 * WHERE COMPANY_NAME = 'ACME Corp'
 * ORDER BY SCHEDULE_NEXT_RUN;
 *
 * -- Get chains that need to run soon (next 24 hours)
 * SELECT * FROM V_BATCH_SCHED_CHAINS 
 * WHERE SCHEDULE_NEXT_RUN BETWEEN SYSTIMESTAMP 
 *   AND SYSTIMESTAMP + INTERVAL '1' DAY
 * ORDER BY SCHEDULE_NEXT_RUN;
 *
 * -- Get chain execution summary by company
 * SELECT COMPANY_NAME, COUNT(*) as total_chains,
 *        SUM(CASE WHEN SCHEDULE_STATE = 'ACTIVE' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as active_chains,
 *        SUM(CASE WHEN SCHEDULE_STATE = 'DISABLED' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as disabled_chains
 * FROM V_BATCH_SCHED_CHAINS 
 * GROUP BY COMPANY_NAME;
 *
 * -- Get chains that haven't run recently (> 7 days)
 * SELECT * FROM V_BATCH_SCHED_CHAINS 
 * WHERE SCHEDULE_LAST_RUN < SYSTIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '7' DAY
 * OR SCHEDULE_LAST_RUN IS NULL;
