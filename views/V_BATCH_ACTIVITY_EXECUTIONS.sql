/**
 * View: V_BATCH_ACTIVITY_EXECUTIONS
 * Description: Comprehensive view of batch activity executions with hierarchical information.
 *              Provides a complete picture of activity execution status, timing, and context
 *              including related process, chain, and company information for monitoring and reporting.
 *
 * Author: Eduardo GutiÃ©rrez Tapia (edogt@hotmail.com)
 *
 * Purpose:
 *   - Monitor activity execution status and performance
 *   - Provide hierarchical view of activity-process-chain relationships
 *   - Support execution time analysis and reporting
 *   - Enable activity execution tracking across companies
 *
 * Query Description:
 *   - Joins activity executions with activities, processes, chains, and companies
 *   - Calculates elapsed time for running and completed executions
 *   - Orders results by execution state (running first) and start time (descending)
 *   - Provides complete context for each activity execution
 *
 * Usage Examples:
 * 
 * -- Get all running activity executions
 * SELECT * FROM V_BATCH_ACTIVITY_EXECUTIONS 
 * WHERE EXECUTION_STATE = 'RUNNING';
 *
 * -- Get activity executions for a specific company
 * SELECT * FROM V_BATCH_ACTIVITY_EXECUTIONS 
 * WHERE COMPANIA_NOMBRE = 'ACME Corp'
 * ORDER BY START_TIME DESC;
 *
 * -- Get long-running activities (> 30 minutes)
 * SELECT * FROM V_BATCH_ACTIVITY_EXECUTIONS 
 * WHERE EXECUTION_STATE = 'RUNNING' 
 * AND START_TIME < SYSTIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '0 0:30:0' DAY TO SECOND;
 *
 * -- Get activity execution summary by company
 * SELECT COMPANIA_NOMBRE, COUNT(*) as total_executions,
 *        SUM(CASE WHEN EXECUTION_STATE = 'COMPLETED' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as completed,
 *        SUM(CASE WHEN EXECUTION_STATE = 'FAILED' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as failed
 * FROM V_BATCH_ACTIVITY_EXECUTIONS 
 * GROUP BY COMPANIA_NOMBRE;
