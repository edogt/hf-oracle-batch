/**
 * View: V_BATCH_RUNNING_PROCESSES
 * Description: Real-time view of currently running batch processes with hierarchical context.
 *              Provides immediate visibility into active process executions
 *              including timing, chain context, and company information for operational monitoring.
 *
 * Author: Eduardo GutiÃ©rrez Tapia (edogt@hotmail.com)
 *
 * Purpose:
 *   - Monitor currently running process executions in real-time
 *   - Provide operational visibility into active batch processes
 *   - Support process execution monitoring and alerting
 *   - Enable real-time performance analysis of running processes
 *
 * Query Description:
 *   - Filters process executions to show only RUNNING state
 *   - Joins with processes, chain executions, chains, and companies for complete context
 *   - Uses PCK_BATCH_TOOLS.ENLAPSEDTIMESTRING for elapsed time calculation
 *   - Provides immediate operational visibility for monitoring dashboards
 *
 * Usage Examples:
 * 
 * -- Get all currently running processes
 * SELECT * FROM V_BATCH_RUNNING_PROCESSES 
 * ORDER BY START_TIME;
 *
 * -- Get running processes for a specific company
 * SELECT * FROM V_BATCH_RUNNING_PROCESSES 
 * WHERE COMPANIA_DESCRIPCION = 'ACME Corp'
 * ORDER BY START_TIME;
 *
 * -- Get long-running processes (> 1 hour)
 * SELECT * FROM V_BATCH_RUNNING_PROCESSES 
 * WHERE START_TIME < SYSTIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '0 1:0:0' DAY TO SECOND
 * ORDER BY START_TIME;
 *
 * -- Get process execution summary by company
 * SELECT COMPANIA_DESCRIPCION, COUNT(*) as running_processes,
 *        AVG(EXTRACT(SECOND FROM (SYSTIMESTAMP - START_TIME))) as avg_running_seconds
 * FROM V_BATCH_RUNNING_PROCESSES 
 * GROUP BY COMPANIA_DESCRIPCION
 * ORDER BY running_processes DESC;
 *
 * -- Get processes by chain
 * SELECT CADENA_DESCRIPCION, COUNT(*) as running_processes,
 *        MIN(START_TIME) as earliest_start,
 *        MAX(START_TIME) as latest_start
 * FROM V_BATCH_RUNNING_PROCESSES 
 * GROUP BY CADENA_DESCRIPCION
 * ORDER BY running_processes DESC;
 *
 * -- Get potentially stuck processes (> 3 hours)
 * SELECT * FROM V_BATCH_RUNNING_PROCESSES 
 * WHERE START_TIME < SYSTIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '0 3:0:0' DAY TO SECOND
 * ORDER BY START_TIME;
 *
 * -- Get process performance analysis
 * SELECT PROCESO_NOMBRE, COUNT(*) as running_count,
 *        AVG(EXTRACT(SECOND FROM (SYSTIMESTAMP - START_TIME))) as avg_running_seconds
 * FROM V_BATCH_RUNNING_PROCESSES 
 * GROUP BY PROCESO_NOMBRE
 * ORDER BY running_count DESC;
