/**
 * View: V_BATCH_SCHED_RUNNING_CHAINS
 * Description: Oracle Scheduler running chains monitoring view.
 *              Provides real-time information about currently executing
 *              Oracle Scheduler chains for operational monitoring and alerting.
 *
 * Author: Eduardo GutiÃ©rrez Tapia (edogt@hotmail.com)
 *
 * Purpose:
 *   - Monitor currently running Oracle Scheduler chains in real-time
 *   - Provide operational visibility into active chain executions
 *   - Support chain execution monitoring and performance analysis
 *   - Enable real-time chain status tracking and alerting
 *
 * Query Description:
 *   - Uses PCK_BATCH_MONITOR.GET_SCHED_RUNNING_CHAINS function to retrieve active chains
 *   - Provides chain execution details including timing and state information
 *   - Enables real-time monitoring of Oracle Scheduler chain performance
 *   - Supports operational dashboards and alerting systems
 *
 * Usage Examples:
 * 
 * -- Get all currently running chains
 * SELECT * FROM V_BATCH_SCHED_RUNNING_CHAINS 
 * ORDER BY START_DATE;
 *
 * -- Get long-running chains (> 1 hour)
 * SELECT * FROM V_BATCH_SCHED_RUNNING_CHAINS 
 * WHERE RUN_DURATION > 3600
 * ORDER BY RUN_DURATION DESC;
 *
 * -- Get chains by state
 * SELECT STATE, COUNT(*) as running_chains,
 *        AVG(RUN_DURATION) as avg_duration
 * FROM V_BATCH_SCHED_RUNNING_CHAINS 
 * GROUP BY STATE
 * ORDER BY running_chains DESC;
 *
 * -- Get potentially stuck chains (> 4 hours)
 * SELECT * FROM V_BATCH_SCHED_RUNNING_CHAINS 
 * WHERE RUN_DURATION > 14400
 * ORDER BY RUN_DURATION DESC;
 *
 * -- Get chain performance summary
 * SELECT 
 *   COUNT(*) as total_running_chains,
 *   AVG(RUN_DURATION) as avg_duration,
 *   MAX(RUN_DURATION) as max_duration,
 *   SUM(RUN_DURATION) as total_duration
 * FROM V_BATCH_SCHED_RUNNING_CHAINS;
 *
 * -- Get chains started in the last hour
 * SELECT * FROM V_BATCH_SCHED_RUNNING_CHAINS 
 * WHERE START_DATE > SYSTIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '1' HOUR
 * ORDER BY START_DATE DESC;
 *
 * -- Get chains with specific comments
 * SELECT * FROM V_BATCH_SCHED_RUNNING_CHAINS 
 * WHERE COMMENTS IS NOT NULL
 * ORDER BY START_DATE;
