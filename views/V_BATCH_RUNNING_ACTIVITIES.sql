/**
 * View: V_BATCH_RUNNING_ACTIVITIES
 * Description: Real-time view of currently running batch activities with context.
 *              Provides immediate visibility into active activity executions
 *              including timing, chain context, and company information for operational monitoring.
 *
 * Author: Eduardo GutiÃ©rrez Tapia (edogt@hotmail.com)
 *
 * Purpose:
 *   - Monitor currently running activity executions in real-time
 *   - Provide operational visibility into active batch processes
 *   - Support activity execution monitoring and alerting
 *   - Enable real-time performance analysis of running activities
 *
 * Query Description:
 *   - Filters activity executions to show only RUNNING state
 *   - Joins with activities, chains, and companies for complete context
 *   - Uses PCK_BATCH_TOOLS.ENLAPSEDTIMESTRING for elapsed time calculation
 *   - Provides immediate operational visibility for monitoring dashboards
 *
 * Usage Examples:
 * 
 * -- Get all currently running activities
 * SELECT * FROM V_BATCH_RUNNING_ACTIVITIES 
 * ORDER BY START_TIME;
 *
 * -- Get running activities for a specific company
 * SELECT * FROM V_BATCH_RUNNING_ACTIVITIES 
 * WHERE COMPANIA_DESCRIPCION = 'ACME Corp'
 * ORDER BY START_TIME;
 *
 * -- Get long-running activities (> 30 minutes)
 * SELECT * FROM V_BATCH_RUNNING_ACTIVITIES 
 * WHERE START_TIME < SYSTIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '0 0:30:0' DAY TO SECOND
 * ORDER BY START_TIME;
 *
 * -- Get running activities by chain
 * SELECT CHAIN_NAME, COUNT(*) as running_activities,
 *        MIN(START_TIME) as earliest_start,
 *        MAX(START_TIME) as latest_start
 * FROM V_BATCH_RUNNING_ACTIVITIES 
 * GROUP BY CHAIN_NAME
 * ORDER BY running_activities DESC;
 *
 * -- Get activity execution summary by company
 * SELECT COMPANIA_DESCRIPCION, COUNT(*) as running_activities,
 *        AVG(EXTRACT(SECOND FROM (SYSTIMESTAMP - START_TIME))) as avg_running_seconds
 * FROM V_BATCH_RUNNING_ACTIVITIES 
 * GROUP BY COMPANIA_DESCRIPCION
 * ORDER BY running_activities DESC;
 *
 * -- Get potentially stuck activities (> 2 hours)
 * SELECT * FROM V_BATCH_RUNNING_ACTIVITIES 
 * WHERE START_TIME < SYSTIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '0 2:0:0' DAY TO SECOND
 * ORDER BY START_TIME;
