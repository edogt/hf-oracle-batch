/**
 * Function: GETJOBSDESTS
 * Description: Oracle Scheduler job destinations retrieval function.
 *              Provides access to Oracle Scheduler job destination information
 *              through a pipelined function that returns job destination details
 *              for monitoring and management purposes.
 *
 * Author: Eduardo GutiÃ©rrez Tapia (edogt@hotmail.com)
 *
 * Purpose:
 *   - Retrieve Oracle Scheduler job destination information
 *   - Provide job destination monitoring capabilities
 *   - Support job destination analysis and reporting
 *   - Enable job destination management operations
 *
 * Query Description:
 *   - Queries USER_SCHEDULER_JOB_DESTS view for job destination information
 *   - Returns pipelined TYP_SCHED_JOB_DESTS_SET for efficient data streaming
 *   - Provides comprehensive job destination details including status and timing
 *   - Enables real-time monitoring of job destinations
 *
 * Usage Examples:
 * 
 * -- Get all job destinations
 * SELECT * FROM TABLE(GETJOBSDESTS())
 * ORDER BY JOB_NAME;
 *
 * -- Get enabled job destinations
 * SELECT * FROM TABLE(GETJOBSDESTS())
 * WHERE ENABLED = 'TRUE'
 * ORDER BY JOB_NAME;
 *
 * -- Get job destinations with recent activity
 * SELECT * FROM TABLE(GETJOBSDESTS())
 * WHERE LAST_START_DATE > SYSTIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '1' DAY
 * ORDER BY LAST_START_DATE DESC;
 *
 * -- Get job destinations by state
 * SELECT STATE, COUNT(*) as destination_count
 * FROM TABLE(GETJOBSDESTS())
 * GROUP BY STATE
 * ORDER BY destination_count DESC;
 *
 * -- Get failed job destinations
 * SELECT * FROM TABLE(GETJOBSDESTS())
 * WHERE FAILURE_COUNT > 0
 * ORDER BY FAILURE_COUNT DESC;
 *
 * -- Get job destinations summary
 * SELECT 
 *   COUNT(*) as total_destinations,
 *   SUM(CASE WHEN ENABLED = 'TRUE' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as enabled_destinations,
 *   SUM(RUN_COUNT) as total_runs,
 *   SUM(FAILURE_COUNT) as total_failures
 * FROM TABLE(GETJOBSDESTS());
 *
